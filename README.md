JavaScript Homework -JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Used a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Used a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
